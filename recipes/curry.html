        <h3>Making the curry:</h3>
        <p>
            <ls>
                <ol>Season the pork chops with salt and pepper. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pork chops to the skillet and cook until browned on both sides, about 3-4 minutes per side. Remove from the skillet and set aside.</ol>
                <ol>In the same skillet, add the chopped onion and garlic and cook until softened, about 2-3 minutes. Add the chopped carrots and potatoes and cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</ol>
                <ol>In a separate saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and whisk until smooth. Cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly.</ol>
                <ol>Add the water to the saucepan and stir until the mixture is smooth. Add the curry powder, garam masala, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Stir until well combined.</ol>
                <ol>Add the curry sauce to the skillet with the vegetables and stir until all ingredients are well combined.</ol>
                <ol>Place the pork chops on top of the curry sauce and vegetables. Cover the skillet with a lid and simmer for 20-30 minutes, or until the pork chops are cooked through and the vegetables are tender.</ol>
                <ol>Serve the pork cutlet Japanese curry over cooked rice.</ol>
