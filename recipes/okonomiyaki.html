        <h3>How to make a homemade Okonomiyaki:</h3>
        <h3>(1)Preparing the batter:</h3>
        <p>
            <ls>
                <ol>1. In a large bowl, combine 1 cup all-purpose flour (plain flour), ¼ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt, ¼ tsp sugar, and ¼ tsp baking powder and mix all together.</ol>
                <ol>2. Peel and grate 5.6 oz nagaimo/yamaimo (mountain yam) in a small bowl. <em>Note: The nagaimo may irritate your skin and cause itchiness. Work quickly and rinse your hands immediately after touching the nagaimo. It is very slimy and slippery, so make sure you have a good grip on the nagaimo if you wear kitchen gloves.</em></ol>
                <ol>3. Add the grated nagaimo and ¾ cup dashi (Japanese soup stock) to the bowl.</ol>
                <ol>4. Mix it all together until combined. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least one hour. Meanwhile, prepare the okonomiyaki sauce and other ingredients. <em>Tip: Resting the batter relaxes the gluten, improves the flavor, and makes the okonomiyaki fluffier. Some okonomiyaki shops refrigerate the batter overnight.</em></ol>
                <ol>5. Now its time to prepare other ingedients</ol>
            </ls>
        </p>

        <h3>(2)Preparing other ingredients:</h3>
        <p>Slice and mince the meat/vegetable/seafood of your choice into tiny bits.</p>

        <h3>(3)Cooking the Okonomiyaki:</h3>
        <p>
            <ls>
                <ol>1. After one hour, take out the batter from the refrigerator. Add 4 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell), ½ cup tenkasu/agedama (tempura scraps), and ¼ cup pickled red ginger (beni shoga or kizami beni shoga) to the bowl. Mix until combined.</ol>
                <ol>2. Add the minced ingredients <em>(meat/vegetable/seafood of your choice)</em> to the batter.</ol>
                <ol>3. In a large pan, heat neutral oil on medium heat. When the frying pan is hot (400ºF or 200ºC), spread the batter in a circle on the pan. We like thicker okonomiyaki (the final thickness is ¾ inches or 2 cm). If you’re new to making okonomiyaki, make it smaller and thinner so it’s easier to flip.</ol>
                <ol>4. Cook the okonomiyaki for <strong>5 minutes.</strong></ol>
                <ol>5. After 5 minutes, flip the okonomiyaki and cook it for <strong>another 5 minutes.</strong></ol>
                <ol>6. And then, flip it again and cook it for <strong>another 5 minutes.</strong></ol>
                <ol>7. After cooking, place the pancake on a plate and add japanese mayonase and okonomiyaki sause on top.</ol>
                <ol>8. Sprinkle some aonori and dried bonito flakes into it.</ol>
            </ls>
        
        </p>
